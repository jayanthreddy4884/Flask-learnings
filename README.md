# Flask-learnings
 Flash Learnings is my hands-on journey into mastering Flask :  from the basics to advanced concepts â€” through structured practice and mini-projects. Every example here reflects real coding, problem-solving, and database integration using SQLAlchemy.

**What I Learned**
Through structured practice sessions, I covered the following Flask concepts:

Flask Basics: App creation, routing, URL building
Templating: Jinja2 templates, HTML rendering, dynamic data passing
Forms Handling: GET/POST methods, WTForms integration, form validation
Database Integration: SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations (CRUD)
Session & Cookies: User session management, secure cookies
Blueprints: Modular application structuring
REST APIs: Building and consuming JSON APIs in Flask
Error Handling: Custom error pages and exception handling
Static & Media Files: Serving CSS, JS, and images efficiently
Configuration Management: Environment-based settings and secrets handling

**Tech Stack**
Backend: Flask (Python)

Database: SQLAlchemy ORM (with SQLite for practice)

Templating Engine: Jinja2

Frontend (Practice Level): HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for quick UI mockups
